# Susanta Baidya
## AI Engineer | Deep Learning Enthusiast | Computer Vision Learner

I was an MSc candidate in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at IIIT Lucknow with a strong foundation in data science, deep learning, NLP, and computer vision. Passionate about solving real-world challenges, I gained hands-on experience in building and deploying AI solutions, from lightning prediction models to defect detection systems. My expertise spanned Python, SQL, cloud technologies, and ML frameworks, which enabled me to develop scalable and efficient solutions. With a track record of competing in hackathons and contributing to open-source projects, I continuously refined my skills through platforms like Kaggle. I was eager to apply my knowledge to data-driven problems, leveraging AI/ML to create impactful and innovative solutions.
